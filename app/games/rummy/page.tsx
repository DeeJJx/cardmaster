          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Objective</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The objective of Rummy is to form sets or runs with your cards and be the first to get rid of all your cards by melding them on the table.
          </p>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Basic Rules</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Rummy is typically played with 2-6 players using a standard 52-card deck. If more players are involved, multiple decks may be used.</li>
            <li>The aim is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) or runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit).</li>
            <li>Aces can be high or low but cannot "wrap around" (e.g., K-A-2 is not a valid run).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Gameplay</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Players are dealt a specific number of cards depending on the number of players (typically 10 cards each for 2-4 players).</li>
            <li>The remaining cards form a draw pile, and the top card is placed face-up to start the discard pile.</li>
            <li>On their turn, players draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard one card.</li>
            <li>The goal is to create valid sets or runs and lay them down on the table.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Melding and Going Out</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Players can lay down valid sets or runs on their turn or add to existing sets/runs on the table.</li>
            <li>The round ends when a player gets rid of all their cards by either melding or discarding their last card.</li>
            <li>In some variations, a player must end with a discard; in others, they can go out without discarding.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Scoring</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>The player who goes out first scores points based on the remaining cards in the other playersâ€™ hands.</li>
            <li>Face cards (K, Q, J) are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1 point, and numbered cards are worth their face value.</li>
            <li>The game continues for a predetermined number of rounds or until a player reaches a target score (e.g., 500 points).</li>
          </ul>
