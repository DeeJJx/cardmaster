          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Objective</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The objective of Bluff is to get rid of all your cards while trying
            to deceive your opponents about the cards you play.
          </p>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Basic Rules</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              Bluff can be played with 3 or more players using a standard
              52-card deck.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each player is dealt an equal number of cards, and the remaining
              cards form a draw pile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players take turns playing cards face down on the pile while
              announcing the rank they claim to be playing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players can bluff about the rank of the cards they are playing; if
              another player suspects a bluff, they can challenge it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the challenge is successful (the player was lying), the bluffer
              picks up the pile. If the challenge fails (the player was
              truthful), the challenger must pick up the pile.
            </li>
            <li>The game continues until a player has no cards left.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">History</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Bluff has various origins, often attributed to traditional games
            like Liar and Cheat. The game emphasizes deception and strategy, and
            it has gained popularity in casual settings for its fun and social
            interaction.
          </p>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Variations</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              **Multiple Decks**: In larger groups, multiple decks can be used
              to keep the game flowing.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Different Ranks**: Players can choose specific ranks to play,
              altering the strategic element.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Challenge Limits**: Some variations limit the number of times a
              player can challenge a bluff in a round.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Strategies</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              **Observe Patterns**: Pay attention to other players' behaviors
              and card-playing patterns to predict their bluffs.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Balance Bluffing and Honesty**: Mix up your strategies by
              bluffing and telling the truth to keep opponents guessing.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Challenge Wisely**: Be cautious when challenging bluffs; only
              challenge when you have a strong suspicion.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Common Mistakes</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              **Bluffing Too Often**: Overusing bluffs can make you predictable
              and lead to losing more cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Not Paying Attention**: Failing to notice patterns can result in
              missed opportunities to challenge bluffs.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Challenging Too Quickly**: Jumping to challenge without
              sufficient evidence can backfire and lead to picking up the pile.
            </li>
          </ul>
