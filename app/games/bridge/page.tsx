            The objective of Bridge is for partnerships to score points by
            winning tricks, with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach a
            specified number of points, typically 100 or more.

          {/* Game History and Origins */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">History and Origins</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Bridge is derived from the game of "Whist," which became popular in
            the 18th century in England. In the late 19th and early 20th
            centuries, new versions of the game, such as "Auction Bridge" and
            eventually "Contract Bridge," were developed. Contract Bridge, the
            modern version we know today, was codified in the 1920s by Harold
            Vanderbilt. Its popularity soared in the mid-20th century, leading
            to the establishment of national and international tournaments,
            making Bridge one of the most respected and skillful card games in
            the world.

          {/* Basic Rules */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Basic Rules</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              Bridge is played with four players in two partnerships. Players
              sit opposite their partners.
            </li>
            <li>
              A standard 52-card deck is used, and the game consists of a series
              of deals, each with a bidding phase and a play phase.
            </li>
            <li>
              The goal during the play phase is to win as many tricks as
              possible to fulfill the contract decided during the bidding phase.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Bidding */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Bidding</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              During the bidding phase, players declare the number of tricks
              their partnership will attempt to win and the suit that will be
              the trump suit (or declare no trump).
            </li>
            <li>
              The highest bid becomes the contract, which the partnership must
              fulfill by winning at least the number of tricks they bid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bidding proceeds clockwise, and players may pass if they do not
              wish to bid.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Gameplay */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Gameplay</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              The player to the left of the declarer (the one who won the
              contract) leads the first trick.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players must follow suit if possible; if not, they may play any
              card.
            </li>
            <li>
              The highest card in the led suit wins the trick unless a trump
              card is played, in which case the highest trump wins.
            </li>
            <li>
              The partnership that wins the contract must try to win the number
              of tricks they bid, while the opposing partnership tries to
              prevent them from doing so.
            </li>

            Variations of Bridge
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Bridge has several variations, each with its own unique rules and
            style of play. Some of the most popular variations include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Duplicate Bridge:</strong> This version is commonly played
              in tournaments. The same deal is played by multiple tables, and
              the objective is to score better than other partnerships playing
              the same hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chicago (Four-Deal Bridge):</strong> In this variation,
              the game consists of four deals, with partnerships rotating after
              each round.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber Bridge:</strong> A more casual version played for
              fun or small stakes. It is played in "rubbers," with the first
              partnership to win two games declared the winner.
            </li>

            Strategies and Tips for Bridge
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Bridge is a game of skill and communication between partners. To
            improve your play, here are some key strategies:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Know the Bidding System:</strong> Understand the bidding
              conventions your partnership is using. Proper communication
              through bidding is essential to success in Bridge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus on High-Card Points (HCP):</strong> When bidding,
              assess your hand’s strength using high-card points (A=4, K=3, Q=2,
              J=1). Typically, 12 or more points are needed to open a bid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Play to Your Partner’s Strengths:</strong> Keep track of
              the cards your partner plays and adjust your strategy accordingly.
              Trust your partner’s bidding and play accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Practice Declarer Play:</strong> As the declarer, plan out
              your play carefully. Try to visualize your opponent’s hands and
              use your trump suit wisely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Defensive Play is Key:</strong> When playing defense,
              focus on communicating with your partner through the cards you
              play. For example, leading with a high card can signal strength in
              that suit.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Common Mistakes */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">
            Common Mistakes to Avoid
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Here are some common errors that players make and how to avoid them:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Overbidding:</strong> Many players get carried away and
              bid too high, overestimating their hand strength. Stick to the
              bidding conventions and trust the points system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ignoring Your Partner’s Signals:</strong> Bridge is a
              partnership game. Ignoring your partner’s bids or play signals can
              cost you valuable tricks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Planning Ahead:</strong> As declarer, failing to plan
              your strategy based on the opening lead and your own hand is a
              common mistake. Always think a few tricks ahead.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Undervaluing the Trump Suit:</strong> Players often
              neglect the power of the trump suit. Remember, the trump suit can
              turn weak cards into trick-winners.
            </li>
          </ul>

          {/* Scoring */}
          <h2 className="card-title text-2xl font-bold">Scoring</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              If the declaring partnership wins the number of tricks they bid,
              they score points. If they fail, the opposing partnership scores
              points.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of each trick varies depending on whether the contract
              is in a suit or no trump.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bonus points are awarded for fulfilling contracts, making
              overtricks, and achieving specific conditions like slams.
            </li>
